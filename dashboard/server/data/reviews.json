      "overnightSummary": "VPD averaged 1.53 kPa, nearly triple the 0.6 kPa seedling target, with only 3% time in optimal range. Environment shows classic dry basement pattern with VPD dropping overnight as humidity rises, then spiking during day cycle.",
      "issuesDetected": [
        "VPD consistently too high (avg 1.53 vs target 0.6)",
        "Humidifier settings completely misaligned - targeting 0.9 kPa when seedlings need 0.6 kPa",
        "Wide VPD swings from 0.36 to 2.69 kPa indicating poor stability",
        "Day cycle showing severe drying (2.0+ kPa) likely from lights"

      "positives": [
        "Humidifier did achieve brief periods in target range (10:00-10:30 AM)",
